Networking in Java involves creating network connections, sending and receiving data over the network, and implementing network protocols. The Java platform provides a robust set of classes and APIs for networking tasks. Some of the key classes and interfaces for networking in Java are:

1. java.net.Socket: Represents a client-side socket that connects to a server. It provides methods for establishing a connection, sending and receiving data.

2. java.net.ServerSocket: Represents a server-side socket that listens for incoming connections from clients. It provides methods for accepting client connections.

3. java.net.InetAddress: Represents an IP address. It provides methods for getting the IP address of a host, resolving host names, and working with IP addresses.

4. java.net.URL: Represents a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). It provides methods for creating, parsing, and accessing the components of a URL.

5. java.net.URI: Represents a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). It provides methods for creating, parsing, and manipulating URIs.

6. java.net.URLConnection: Represents a connection to a resource specified by a URL. It provides methods for establishing a connection, reading from and writing to the resource.

7. java.net.HttpURLConnection: Subclass of URLConnection specifically designed for making HTTP connections. It provides methods for working with HTTP requests and responses.

These classes and interfaces are part of the java.net package in Java. They allow you to perform a wide range of networking tasks, such as creating client-server applications, communicating over HTTP, working with IP addresses, and more.

To perform networking operations in Java, you typically use these classes to establish connections, read and write data, handle exceptions, and manage network resources. You can combine them with other APIs, such as I/O streams and multithreading, to build robust networking applications.
